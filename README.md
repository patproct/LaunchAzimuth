# LaunchAzimuth
Launch azimuth calculator

I initially wrote this code to calculate proper launch azimuths for launching rockets and shuttles in Kerbal Space Program. I quickly adpated it to work for vehicles launched from Earth at latitudes other than the equator. It is easily operated through the command line.
